Business Problem

Create a demand model for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.

Conclusion
1.	Company should focus on expanding business during spring.
2.	Company should focus on expanding business during September.
3.	Based on previous data it is expected to have a boom in number of users once situation comes back to normal, compared to 2019.
4.	There would be fewer bookings during Light Snow or Rain; they could probably use this time to service the bikes without having business impact.
